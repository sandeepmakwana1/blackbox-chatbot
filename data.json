Organizations seeking full client proposals may engage directly with KPMG or request redacted case studies under non-disclosure agreements.  \n- The 2014 Atlantic Highlands proposal is over four years old; project scope and formatting standards may have evolved since.  \n- Some third-party hosting (e.g., Scribd) may require accounts or subscriptions to download full documents; official KPMG portals are preferred when available.  \n- Regulatory and budget proposals illustrate methodology and structure but may not align with proprietary client requirements. Customization is necessary.  \n\nFor deeper insights or additional samples in specific industries or regions beyond those listed, direct engagement with relevant KPMG practice leaders or proposal operations teams is recommended.",

Government procurement portals occasionally identify RFPs KPMG has bid on, though the actual responses remain proprietary.\n\nTable of Findings\n\n| Industry/Sector | Service Offering                 | Region/Country        | Type                   | Year/Time Frame | Source Link                                                              | Brief Description/Notes                                                                                         |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Generic/All     | All services                     | Global                | Template/Sample        | N/A             | KPMG \u201cRequest for proposal\u201d global page ([kpmg.com](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/misc/request-for-proposal.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))              | Client-facing RFP submission form inviting organizations worldwide to request proposals from KPMG.                 |\n| Generic/All     | All services                     | Switzerland           | Template/Sample        | N/A             | KPMG Switzerland RfP page ([kpmg.com](https://kpmg.com/ch/en/misc/rfp.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))                           | Country-specific form allowing Swiss clients to submit RfPs for KPMG\u2019s services.                                   |\n| Generic/All     | All services                     | Estonia               | Template/Sample        | N/A             | KPMG Estonia RFP submission confirmation ([kpmg.com](https://kpmg.com/ee/en/misc/request-for-proposal/rfp-success.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))            | Sample \u201cSuccessful RFP submission\u201d confirmation page, demonstrating KPMG\u2019s post-submission template.             |\n| Generic/All     | All services                     | N/A                   | Template/Sample        | N/A             | APMP Reactive Response Template ([apmp.org](https://www.apmp.org/proposalsfordummies/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))                     | Industry-standard Word template for structuring responses to RFP questions; adaptable for KPMG proposal teams.    |\n| Government      | Consulting (Finance, Accounting, Audit) | New York City, US     | Real Example           | 2017\u20132020       | CheckbookNYC listing for CT100220181400859 ([checkbooknyc.com](https://www.checkbooknyc.com/contract_details/agid/3890853/doctype/CT1/newwindow?utm_source=chatgpt.com))          | Official NYC contract awarded to KPMG via RFP for finance/audit consulting; lists award method and scope details. |\n\nSummary of Observations\n\n- Publicly posted RFP response documents authored by KPMG remain confidential; direct examples of KPMG proposals are not available online.\n- KPMG maintains \u201cRequest for Proposal\u201d submission forms on its country-specific websites, serving as templates for clients to initiate engagements.\n- Industry bodies like APMP provide generic \u201cReactive Response\u201d templates that proposal teams (including those at KPMG) can use to structure answers to RFP requirements.\n- Government procurement portals (e.g., CheckbookNYC) identify RFPs where KPMG won contracts, but the actual response documents are proprietary.\n- Templates and forms vary by region but share common elements (contact info, requirement summaries, submission confirmations). Additional customization is needed by capture managers and proposal teams to align with specific service offerings and client requirements.\n\nLimitations and Next Steps\n\n- Due to confidentiality, real KPMG proposal documents are not publicly disclosed. For internal use, KPMG proposal teams rely on proprietary templates and knowledge bases.\n- Should the user require industry-specific or service-line-focused sample outlines, further clarification on preferred sectors or engagement types will help target more tailored templates (e.g., audit vs. advisory).\n- Engagement teams may consider combining KPMG country-specific RFP forms with APMP response templates to develop fully compliant, client-focused proposals.",

Since I have not specified my preferences for several key dimensions, treat those as open-ended or flexible, as explained below.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Clarify the Following Dimensions (If Not Provided)\n\nBefore proceeding, check whether I have provided answers to the following questions. If not, treat each as open-ended (accept all possible options), and document your approach for each.\n\n- **Industry or Sector**: No specific industry or sector has been specified. Include all industries (e.g., IT consulting, audit services, healthcare, government projects) and note this breadth in your findings.\n- **Type of Proposal**: I have not indicated whether I am seeking a real, publicly available proposal, a sample/template, or a best practices guide. Include any or all types, but clearly label them in your results.\n- **Region or Country**: No particular region or country has been specified. Include proposals from all geographic regions and note the origin in your findings.\n- **Level of Detail**: I have not specified whether I need the full proposal, or if an executive summary or highlights are sufficient. Include any available level of detail, and clearly describe what is available for each.\n- **Time Period**: No particular timeframe has been specified. Include proposals from any available time period, but note the year(s) for each.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Research Steps\n\n### A. Identify and Collect KPMG RFP Proposals\n\n- Search for KPMG RFP proposals across various sectors and regions.\n    - Prioritize official and primary sources such as KPMG\u2019s own website, official client or government procurement portals, and reputable industry repositories.\n    - If real proposals are not available due to confidentiality, also look for sample/templates or best practice guides published by KPMG or on authoritative consulting industry platforms.\n- For each proposal, record:\n    - Industry/Sector\n    - Proposal Type (real, sample/template, best practices guide)\n    - Region/Country of origin\n    - Level of detail (full proposal, executive summary, highlights)\n    - Year/Time period\n    - Source link (prefer official or primary sources)\n    - Brief description of the proposal contents\n\n### B. Organize Findings in a Table\n\n- Create a table summarizing each proposal according to the attributes above:\n\n| Proposal Name/Title        | Industry/Sector | Type                  | Region/Country | Detail Level    | Year | Source Link | Description |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------|------|-------------|-------------|\n| Example: KPMG IT Audit... | IT Consulting   | Real Proposal         | USA            | Full Document   | 2022 | [Link]      | ...         |\n\n### C. Summarize and Highlight Best Matches\n\n- After the table, write a brief narrative summary:\n    - Highlight any especially relevant or comprehensive proposals.\n    - Note if there are any gaps in publicly available information (e.g., if real proposals are not available, or if only templates can be found).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Formatting and Presentation\n\n- Please submit your findings in a Markdown-formatted report.\n    - Start with a brief introduction outlining your research approach and any challenges encountered.\n    - Include the summary table as described.\n    - Follow with the narrative summary and recommendations.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Language\n\n- Unless I specify otherwise, respond in English.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Source Prioritization\n\n- Prioritize official or primary sources:\n    - KPMG\u2019s official website or publications.\n    - Official procurement or government portals.\n    - Reputable consulting industry repositories.\n- Avoid aggregator sites or SEO-driven blogs unless no primary sources exist and note this if necessary.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Follow-Up\n\n- If you encounter multiple proposals of interest, recommend which are most relevant based on comprehensiveness and alignment with typical RFP best practices.\n\n---\n\n**If at any point you require clarification on my preferences for any dimension, please document the uncertainty and proceed with the broadest reasonable search.**",

This full-length proposal demonstrates KPMG\u2019s approach to government infrastructure RFPs, including detailed task breakdowns, compliance frameworks, and team qualifications. No more recent full KPMG proposals are publicly accessible, reflecting confidentiality constraints.\n\n- **Sample/Template Documents**  \n  While full proposals are typically confidential, KPMG-branded templates like the \u201cKPMG IT PID Template\u201d provide structural guidance for proposal components (scope, governance, deliverables) ([scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/439890778/Deloitte-Proposal?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Such templates can serve as internal starting points when developing RFP responses in IT and related sectors.\n\n- **Best-Practice Guides**  \n  The \u201cCreating Effective Proposals\u201d slide deck offers a concise set of writing and formatting guidelines tailored to consulting proposals ([slideplayer.com](https://slideplayer.com/slide/8674845/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). It covers rhetorical tone, active vs. passive voice, bullet usage, and checking against RFP requirements\u2014key for ensuring proposal clarity and evaluator focus.\n\n- **Gaps and Considerations**  \n  - Public, full-text KPMG proposals are scarce; most are confidential.  \n  - Available materials skew toward consulting-methodology guidance rather than sector-specific RFP examples.  \n  - Where real proposals are inaccessible, leveraging KPMG templates and best-practice guides is essential.\n\n**Recommendations for Proposal Teams**\n\n1. **Leverage the 2014 Integrity Monitor Proposal**  \n   \u2013 Use its structure (executive summary, understanding of needs, approach, qualifications, sample engagements, rates, bios, appendices) as a high-level blueprint.  \n   \u2013 Adapt task breakdowns and compliance checklists for similar government or infrastructure projects.\n\n2. **Adopt KPMG\u2019s Writing Guidelines**  \n   \u2013 Integrate best-practice advice from \u201cCreating Effective Proposals\u201d to ensure customer-centric tone, active voice, and clear mapping to RFP criteria.  \n   \u2013 Emphasize theme statements, feature/benefit tables, and callouts to highlight strengths.\n\n3. **Customize the IT PID Template**  \n   \u2013 Use the KPMG IT PID template to frame proposal sections such as project scope, deliverables, governance, and risk.  \n   \u2013 Align template headings with RFP Section L/Evaluation Criteria to facilitate compliance checks.\n\n4. **Enhance with Internal Knowledge**  \n   \u2013 Combine these public artifacts with internal KPMG capture-management tools, win-themes frameworks, and sector-specific data for a comprehensive response.  \n   \u2013 Engage solution engineers early to draft technical approaches that avoid generic boilerplate.\n\nBy synthesizing the real proposal structure with KPMG-branded templates and writing guidelines, proposal teams can build compelling, client-focused RFP responses aligned with KPMG\u2019s brand, methodology, and quality standards.",
